# COVID-19 cases and deaths by age and sex

What shall we name this database?

This project is currently in development, stay tuned for documentation. You can get preliminary output in 5 and 10-year age groups in the `/Data` folder. This contains columns for `Cases`, `Deaths`, and `Tests` (presently only available by age for Denmark). There are more populations availale in the unharmonized input database (`inputDB.csv`) because they may be awaiting additional inputs needed to harmonize age groups.

Here's an overview of populations available in the `inputDB`

Most populations in the database contain multiple time snapshots, and all are continually monitored for new data releases.  All statistics reported here are **cumulative**. 

Source documentation and a methods protocol are forthcoming. These results are provisional and may change if we decide to throw out particular sources, or if we change our minds about how to split age groups, etc. So **please always use the most up-to-date version**.

If you know of sources for other populations, please either email, Tweet, or leave an *Issue* in this repository, and we'll look into it. If you would like to assist this project in gathering data, or other tasks, please let us know and I'm sure we can find a task!
